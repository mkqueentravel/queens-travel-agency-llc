Client shall keep the following documents in case of damage or loss of luggage: travel ticket; baggage check-in slip; and photographs, if applicable.

  ## Insurance
  -  - **Travel Insurance** We strongly recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance to protect against unforeseen events. It is your responsibility to review and understand your coverage.
  -  17. Travel Insurance Agency recommends Client obtains travel insurance for all travel plans. As the travel booking agent (when applicable), Agency has a professional responsibility to recommend the purchase of travel insurance to protect activities within the Itinerary. While Agency does offer coverage through certain carriers, Agency cannot compare all the policies or companies currently in the marketplace. This responsibility rests solely with Client to determine the proper policy and Agency advises Client to do its research and find coverage that best fits Client’s individual needs. CLIENT UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT THEY HAVE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO READ THE TRAVEL INSURANCE POLICY WHEN IT ARRIVES. INSURANCE INFORMATION INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, DETAILS ON THE EXTENT OF COVERAGE AND PROCEDURES FOR MAKING A CLAIM. If Client declines travel insurance, Client acknowledges and accepts liability for any cancellation penalties, damages, and/or out-of-pocket expenses incurred. Client also acknowledges and accepts responsibility for arranging and paying for any treatment in case of a medical emergency while traveling. If coverage is declined, Client has waived its right to this important coverage and Client’s Itinerary confirmation will note “declined” next to the travel insurance section. If Client has not purchased travel insurance, Client agrees to REVIEW THE INSURANCE DECLINATION CONFIRMATION FOR ACCURACY and contact Agency immediately if Client believes Client has travel insurance and the confirmation is incorrect. Failure to contact Agency will be considered a waiver of travel insurance. All requests for claim services or reimbursement under the travel insurance policy must be filed directly with the travel insurance provider in accordance with the policy terms and conditions which Client is responsible for reviewing upon receipt. Agency is not able to provide advice with regard to possible cancellations and any associated insurance claims processing. All queries regarding cancellation, penalties, and coverage should be directed to Client’s particular travel insurance provider. Agency will not communicate with the insurance provider on behalf of Client.  Accordingly, Client acknowledges that Agency cannot be involved in any aspect of an insurance claim/request for service.  CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT Agency HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE TRAVEL INSURANCE PROVIDER OR ITS COVERAGE DECISIONS AND, AS A RESULT, Agency IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR POLICY COVERAGE, CLAIMS PROCESSING, OR THE DENIAL OF ANY CLAIMS.
