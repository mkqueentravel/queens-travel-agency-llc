Dear Reservations and Concierge Teams,

I'm writing from Preferred Partner agency Fora Travel, IATA 33520476, to confirm the stay of our clients, {{***Mr. Kyle and Mrs. Karlie McDougle and their children Clare (girl-11), Mason (boy-8), and Jenny (girl-6)***}}. We have them in the {{Room Type}}}} for {{dates}}, {{X}}7 nights. {{Additional requests....Please set up the sofa bed for one of the children.}}

{{Thank you for confirming their transfers and itinerary earlier this week. Since their pick-up time on the 25th is not until 4:15pm, is there a chance they can have a late check-out?}}

Please place this note in their suite along with your VIP welcome amenity:
{{Dear Karlie, Kyle, Clare, Mason, and Jenny,
Welcome to Four Seasons Hualalai! Wishing you all the fun in the sun!

{{ Mr. and Mrs. McDougle celebrate their wedding anniversary on July 22nd. If there's anything you could set up for that date, I'm sure they would greatly appreciate it! This will be their 15th. 

No allergies or dietary requirements for anyone in the family. }}

Thank you!
