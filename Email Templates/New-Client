Hi {{Client Name}},

Thank you for choosing **Queen's Travel Agency LLC**, powered by [Fora Travel, Inc. ("Fora")](https://www.foratravel.com/), for your travel planning needs.  I, Mary Kathryn Queen, am the owner of Queen's Travel Agency LLC and operate as an independent travel advisor of Fora Travel, Inc. (“Fora”).


I'm excited to help plan your trip. I have a few questions to get started: 
- Where do you want to go? or What type of experience are you looking for (beach, cruise, skiing, city/culture, etc.)?
- Is there a reason for this trip (anniversary, birthday, honeymoon, just need a break)?
- How long do you have for this trip?
- Is there a budget you would like us to be respectful of?
- What trips have really worked for you/your group previously?  What hotels have you stayed in before that you have loved?


Additionally, please provide the following information:
- Names of everyone traveling
- Ages if traveling with children
- Dates (or timeframe) for travel

Once I receive the above details, I can begin planning an awesome trip for you [and your family/group]! Also, please review our attached travel booking terms and conditions.
